    "bio": "Hi there! My name is Jen Perez. I'm a brand new full stack Java developer based in Atlanta, GA. I've been a creator as far back as I can remember. After bouts of writing and drawing comic books with my friends, I listened to my parents and got a \"real\" degree in Political Science from the University of Georgia. I opened and operated a retail store. I tried working as a banker. I taught fitness classes. But, you can take the girl out of the art, but you can't take the art out of the girl. I've since written a screenplay for a feature film and for a series. (Ask about my IMDb creds later!) I was teaching high school literature up until the COVID pandemic decimated our little private school, and I joined the millions of unemployed Americans. So, that brings us to today. I discovered web development almost by accident. I was trying to edit and maintain my husband's company website, and the little bit of HTML that I had learned back in the MySpace days wasn't cutting it. (Don't lie...you know you had those glitter .gifs too!) I started teaching myself HTML and CSS, which led me to Generation USA. I applied, and was chosen for the 2021-2022 Generation USA Jr. Full Stack Developer program through Atlanta Technical College. Now, I currently have 560+ training hours and experience developing and programming full stack Java applications. I'm currently working as a junior software engineer, and I hope to be a software architect in the future.",
